\chapter{Application and Performance of GNN Algorithm}
\label{chapter-6}

% This chapter focuses on the track finding algorithm development and its application on the publicly available dataset designed for the Kaggle TrackML challenge. The preliminary results related to track reconstruction efficiency and purity metrics are presented and discussed.

The main application of the GNN algorithm on the trackML data, the data preparation, what data was exactly used and why, the ML classification algorithm used to build the edge connections. The main results we get from application of this algorithm, the track reconstruction efficiency, the purity metrics, computational performance. Comparison with other algorithms.

\section{Application and Performance on the TrackML Model}

\subsection{Data Preparation}
Talk specifically about the TrackML data here and how it was prepared. How the trackml hits are converted into nodes and edges. Close proximity node merging. Checks that are put in place in order to make sure there are no hits that have the same module id (more than 2 hits that are simultaneously in the same module and volume and layer).
