%\begin{itemize}
%\item Introduction to the thesis
%\item The overall narrative and where this thesis is going
%\item "The bigger picture"
%\item Particle detector experiments in general, the increase in luminosity, the physics motivation, the challenges to tracking that arise from this - the CPU usage, optimisations etc, the pileup, emphasize the i importance of optimisations in tracking
%\item The importance of ML is tackling these challenges
%\item Graph networks as a solution which is used in tracking, traditionally multi-layered perceptrons are trained, but this approach is unique
%\item First it is important to find good edge connections in the network (QT task) and then find good track candidates within the network that can be extracted (GNN)

%Our challenge program inserts itself in a bigger effort of the Atlas collaboration (one of the three experiments analyzing data collected at CERN on the Large Hadron Colliderâ€“ LHC) to use Machine Learning to assist high energy physicists in discovering and characterizing new particles.
%In the LHC, proton bunches (beams) circulates and collide at high energy. Each beam- beam collision (further called an event) produces a firework of new particles (figure 2). To identify the types and measure the kinematic properties of these particles, a complex apparatus, the detector records the small energy deposited by the particles when they impact well-defined locations in the detector.
%The tracking problem refers to reconstructing the trajectories of the particles from the information recorded by the detector. The augmentation of data throughput creates a major scaling bottleneck for the associated pattern recognition-tracking task. Thus, current methods [5] will soon become obsolete and there is an urgent need for novel algorithms.
