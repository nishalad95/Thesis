\chapter{Summary and Outlook}
\label{chapter-8}
% conclusions, summary and outlook on the entire thesis


% imrprovements in track reconstruction for the future are imperative for growth and improvement in particle detector experiments

% chapter 4 - successfully shows good improvement in saving computing resources whilst maininting efficiency

% gnn - also good and promising preliminary results for the endcap, more is needed for the barrel, good to show that deep learning is not always necessary and good to save cpu resources here

% specifics - implementation of KFs here is unique and is successful, the iterative methodology of ambiguity resolution in the graph network works well and is unique, utilising GMR and message passing within the network helps a lot 

% further detailed analysis on performance studies especially executing time comparisons etc

% outlook to the future
