% SVS example:
%This thesis details research in experimental particle physics. The primary contributions are on the improvement of the data analysis algorithms which are used to process proton-proton collisions induced within the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and the analysis of candidate Higgs boson events.

%The primary outcome of the research is an advancement of knowl- edge about how the Universe works on the most fundamental level, encoded for example in the improved measurement of the funda- mental constants of the Standard Model, or in the observation of previously unseen particles or interactions. Although this kind of knowledge doesn’t always have an immediate and direct relevance for society, potential applications are impossible to rule out and could have a very large impact further in the future, as has been seen with previous advancements in fundamental science.

%The research does find indirect application in the form of associ- ated technological developements that have transferable application within different fields. The cutting-edge techniques developed at CERN for ATLAS and the LHC have found many spin-off appli- cations elsewhere in society, for example the World Wide Web, high-field magnet technology in MRI, touch-screen technology and cloud computing. Fundamental physics, as a method of proposing difficult and novel problems, can therefore be seen as a way to generate innovative technologies.

%Working in the field also helps to train skilled researchers, which can be redeployed to other areas of society to tackle various problems. In this thesis advanced statistical and data science methods are employed. Such methods currently find wide and varied use in many fields. The training of such highly skilled individuals has a sustained and significant positive economic impact.

%Finally, the work carried at ATLAS and the LHC is widely publicised – support of and interest in fundamental physics research helps to generate excitement about science and technology, and educate people about how the Universe works. This in turn attracts people into the area, propagating the benefits described above.


% CD example:
% To continue building on our understanding of fundamental physics, it is crucial that we exploit the huge quantities of data from the LHC to make both precision measurements of the Standard Model and search for Beyond Standard Model pro- cesses. Therefore, the ATLAS detector requires frequent and significant upgrades to both its hardware and its software to make these discoveries possible. The work in this thesis directly contributes to the ongoing efforts to develop faster and more efficient algorithms to reconstruct event data to be used in many different physics analyses.
%Outside of high energy physics and, indeed, outside of academia, techniques such as the Hough Transform are employed for a wide range of imaging tasks. The novel concept of applying Principal Component Analysis to parameterise objects for the Hough Transform could be leveraged to improve detection capabilities in such tasks, and contribute to the field of computer vision overall.
